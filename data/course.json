  "course_description": "This is a [freshman advising seminar](https://firstyear.mit.edu/office-first-year/first-year-advising/advising-options). The professor of a FAS is the first year advisor to the (no more than 8) students in the seminar.\n\nThe use of Global Positioning System (GPS) in a wide variety of applications has exploded in the last few years. In this seminar we explore how positions on the Earth were determined before GPS; how GPS itself works and the range of applications in which GPS is now a critical element. This seminar is followed by a [UROP](http://web.mit.edu/urop/) research project in the spring semester where results from precise GPS measurements will be analyzed and displayed on the Web.\n",
